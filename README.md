# Strict

## Overview
PSD to HTML/CSS practice. It contains features like form validation and image popup, done with JS/jQuery. I used icons and fonts from Font Awesome 4 (https://fontawesome.com/).

## Notes
The original PSD was downloaded from Best PSD Freebies (http://www.bestpsdfreebies.com/). It was created by Ekhtiar Mahmud (http://www.bestpsdfreebies.com/freebie/strict-portfolio-template/). All rights reserved.
